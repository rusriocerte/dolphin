One way to enhance the security of SSH connections is to use a key pair for authentication instead of a password. A key pair can be generated with the keygen utility, which creates two files: a public key and a private key. The public key can be copied to any remote server that needs to allow SSH access, while the private key must be kept secret and protected by the user. The private key acts as a proof of identity for the user, and the public key verifies that the user has the matching private key.

To generate a key pair with the keygen utility, the user needs to specify the type and size of the key, and optionally a passphrase to encrypt the private key. The passphrase adds an extra layer of security, as it prevents anyone from using the private key without knowing the passphrase. However, the passphrase also means that the user has to enter it every time they use the private key for SSH authentication.
  
After generating a key pair, the user can copy the public key to a remote server using the copy-id utility or manually. The copy-id utility automates the process of appending the public key to the authorized\_keys file on the remote server, which is where SSH looks for public keys that are allowed to access the server. Alternatively, the user can manually copy and paste the public key to the authorized\_keys file using a text editor or a command line tool.
  
Once the public key is copied to the remote server, the user can use SSH to connect to the server without entering a password. SSH will automatically use the private key that matches the public key on the server, and ask for the passphrase if it is set. The user can also use SSH agent to store the private key and passphrase in memory, so that they do not have to enter them every time they use SSH.
  
SSH agent is a program that runs in the background and manages the private keys and passphrases for SSH authentication. The user can add their private keys to the SSH agent using the add utility, and then use SSH to connect to any remote server that has the corresponding public key. The SSH agent will automatically provide the private key and passphrase to SSH, so that the user does not have to enter them manually.
  
To use SSH agent, the user needs to start it with the agent utility and set the environment variable SSH\_AUTH\_SOCK to point to the socket file that the agent creates. The user can also use the eval utility to run the agent and set the environment variable in one command. The user can then add their private keys to the agent with the add utility, and use SSH as usual.
  
Using key pairs for SSH authentication has several benefits over using passwords. Key pairs are more secure, as they are harder to guess or crack than passwords. Key pairs also allow for more fine-grained control over who can access a remote server, as each user can have their own key pair and the server can revoke or grant access to specific keys. Key pairs also enable passwordless login, which is more convenient and faster than typing a password every time.
