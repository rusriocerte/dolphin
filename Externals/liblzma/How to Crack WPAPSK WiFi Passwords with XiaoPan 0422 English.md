# How to Crack WPA-PSK WiFi Passwords with XiaoPan 0.4.2.2 (English)
 
If you want to hack into a WiFi network that uses WPA-PSK encryption, you need a tool that can perform a brute-force attack on the password. One of the best tools for this purpose is XiaoPan 0.4.2.2 (English), a Linux-based operating system that comes with several WiFi cracking tools pre-installed.

In this article, we will show you how to use XiaoPan 0.4.2.2 (English) to crack WPA-PSK WiFi passwords in a few simple steps.
 
## Step 1: Download and Burn XiaoPan 0.4.2.2 (English)
 
The first thing you need to do is to download the ISO file of XiaoPan 0.4.2.2 (English) from its official website or from a torrent site. The file size is about 70 MB and it can be burned to a CD or a USB flash drive using any burning software.
 
Once you have the ISO file, insert the CD or the USB flash drive into your computer and boot from it. You may need to change the boot order in your BIOS settings to do this.
 
## Step 2: Scan for WiFi Networks
 
After booting from XiaoPan 0.4.2.2 (English), you will see a desktop with several icons. The one you need to click on is called "Minidwep-gtk". This will launch a graphical user interface that will scan for nearby WiFi networks and display them in a list.
 
You can see the network name (SSID), the encryption type (WEP, WPA, WPA2), the signal strength, and the MAC address of each network. You can also see if there are any clients connected to the network by clicking on the "Clients" tab.
 
To crack a WPA-PSK WiFi password, you need to select a network that uses WPA or WPA2 encryption and has at least one client connected to it. This is because you need to capture a handshake between the client and the router, which contains the encrypted password.
 
## Step 3: Capture the Handshake
 
Once you have selected a target network, click on the "Reaver" button at the bottom of the window. This will launch another window that will attempt to capture the handshake using a tool called Reaver.
 
Reaver works by exploiting a flaw in the WPS (WiFi Protected Setup) feature of some routers, which allows it to guess the PIN code of the router and retrieve the password from it.
 
Reaver will display its progress in terms of percentage and time elapsed. It may take several hours or even days to crack the PIN code, depending on the router model and the signal strength.
 
You can also try to speed up the process by using another tool called Aircrack-ng, which can perform a dictionary attack on the password using a wordlist file.
 
## Step 4: Crack the Password
 
Once Reaver has captured the handshake, it will display the PIN code and the password of the target network in plain text. You can also see them in the terminal window by typing "cat /tmp/reaver.txt".
 
You can now use this password to connect to the WiFi network and access its resources.
 
## Conclusion
 
XiaoPan 0.4.2.2 (English) is a powerful tool that can crack WPA-PSK WiFi passwords using Reaver and Aircrack-ng. However, it is not guaranteed to work on every router and it may take a long time to complete.
 
Therefore, you should only use it for educational purposes and not for illegal or malicious activities. You should also respect the privacy and security of other WiFi users and not abuse their networks.
